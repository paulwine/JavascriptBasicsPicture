                  <h2>Javscript Basics</h2> 
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language, JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
                   It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browers or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                   programmatic control over them.
                   </p> 
                   <ul>
                     <li>
                       <u>Variable Declarations</u> <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cupt you fill with coffee, the cup 
                       holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be indetifies with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers,
                      </p><h5>var x;</h5>
                      
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          <u>Variable Assignment</u><p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable, <h5>var x = 10;</h5>
                          </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          <u>Data Types</u> <p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variable you need to know the data type.  
                            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -</p> <h5>true</h5> <p> or <h5>false,</h5> <p>null - </p><h5>null</h5>
                            <p>aka nothing; Number</p><h5> 42 </h5><p>or</p><h5> 3.14159, </h5><p>String -</p><h5>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"; </h5>
                            <p>Array - </p><h5>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</h5><p>and Object - </p><h5>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</h5>
                      

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <u>Conditionals</u><p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks
                          based on values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional
                          statements:</p><h5>if</h5><p>a specified codition is true, do this code in our block;</p><h5>else if</h5><p>
                          to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;</p><h5>else</h5><p>we execute this block of code;</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <u>Loops</u><p>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will 
                            repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!
                          </p>

                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <u>Function</u><p>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it
                          as a list of instructions.  As aan example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw
                          the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                        </p>
                      </li>
