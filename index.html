                  <h2>Javscript Basics</h2> 
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language, JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
                   It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browers or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                   programmatic control over them.

                   <ul>
                     <li>
                       <u>Variable Declarations</u> <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cupt you fill with coffee, the cup 
                       holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be indetifies with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers,
                      </p><h5>var x;</h5>
                      
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          <u>Variable Assignment</u><p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable, <h5>var x = 10;</h5>
                          </p>
                      </li>

                      <li>
                          <u>Data Types</u> <p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variable you need to know the data type.  
                            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -</p> <h5>true</h5> <p> or <h5>false,</h5> <p>null - </p><h5>null</h5>
                            <p>aka nothing;</p>
                          </p>

                      </li>
